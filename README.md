# Color Palette Generator Web App

This is a simple web application that allows users to generate color palettes based on a selected color and color scheme mode. It retrieves color data from the [Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) and displays the generated color palette on the screen.

## Usage

To use the Color Palette Generator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. In the web application interface, you will see a color input field where you can select a color using the color picker.

3. Next, select a color scheme mode from the dropdown menu. The available options are:
   - Monochrome
   - Monochrome-dark
   - Monochrome-light
   - Analogic
   - Complement
   - Analogic-complement
   - Triad

4. Click the "Get color scheme" button to generate the color palette.

5. The color palette will be displayed on the screen. Each color in the palette is represented by a colored box and its corresponding hexadecimal value.

6. You can repeat the process by selecting different colors and color scheme modes.
